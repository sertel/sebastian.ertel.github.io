Towards Implicit Parallel Programming for Systems (Ph.D. defense talk)	Talk	talk-phd	Ph.D. defense	2019-09-04	Dresden, Germany	https://sertel.github.io/files/phd_defense_2019_talk.pdf	This is the talk for my Ph.D. defense and basically describes the core foundations of Ohua.
Becoming Friends - Ohua in Database Management Systems	Talk	talk-snowflake	Snowflake Interview	2019-02-06	Berlin, Germany	https://sertel.github.io/files/ohua_dbs_snowflake_2019_talk.pdf	I gave this talk at Snowlfake in Berlin. It is the first talk where I draw bring Ohua in its current incarnation back to database management systems. Along these lines I gave my student [Justus Adam](https://justus.science) the topic for his Masters Thesis.
Scalable Operating System Design	Talk	talk-os	Huawei Interview	2019-03-26	Munich, Germany	https://sertel.github.io/files/os_comparison_huawei_2019_talk.pdf	I gave this during the interview process for a Senior Research position at Huawei. Since I was not an OS person, my task was to review a monolith and micro-kernel-based OS. I chose Singularity, of course!
Tech Problem: Ohua, Microservices and Microkernel-based Operating Systems	Talk	talk-tech-problem	Huawei Interview	2019-03-26	Munich, Germany	https://sertel.github.io/files/tech_problem_huawei_2019_talk.pdf	This talk that (for the first time) establishes the connection between Ohua-based microservices and services in a micro-kernel-based OS.
Ÿauhau - Compiling (Microservices) for Concise Code and Efficient I/O 	Talk	talk-yauhau	[27th International Conference on Compiler Construction](https://cc-conference.github.io/18/)	2018-02-25	Vienna, Austria	https://sertel.github.io/files/yauhau_cc_2018_talk.pdf	The talk introduces the work from the Ÿauhau paper that is based on Ohua's programming model.
Ohua in Big Data Systems	Talk	talk-ohua_bd	[9th International Workshop on Programming Models and Applications forMulticores and Manycores](https://ppopp18.sigplan.org/track/pmam-2018)	2018-02-25	Vienna, Austria	https://sertel.github.io/files/ohua_big_data_pmam_2018_talk.pdf	This talk gives a brief introduction on our approach to speed up sequential bottlenecks in big data systems (Hadoop Map/Reduce, Spark, Flink) using Ohua. This is where I introduced the idea behind `smap` for the first time.
Ohua - Stateful Functions	Talk	talk-ohua	[12th International Conference on Principles and Practices of Programming on the Java Platform: virtual machines, languages, and tools](http://pppj2015.cs.fit.edu/)	2015-02-25	Melbourne, Florida, USA	https://sertel.github.io/files/ohua_pppj_2015_talk.pdf	This is the talk where I presented the idea of a stateful function for the first time.
Non-blocking Live Updates for Dataflow Systems	Talk	talk-updates-middleware	[15th International Middleware Conference](https://2014.middleware-conference.org/)	2014-11-12	Bordeaux, France	https://sertel.github.io/files/updates_middleware_2014_talk.pdf	This talk presents the basic ideas of the algorithm for non-blocking live updates. For a more detailed view, please have a look at the according paper.
Fast Travellers	Talk	talk-fast-travellers	[26th International Symposium on DIStributed Computing](http://www.lasid.ufba.br/disc2012/view/index.php)	2012-10-17	Salvador da Bahia, Brazil	https://sertel.github.io/files/travellers_disc_2012.pdf	This was my first academic talk tried to sum up the problem and approach from my Master's Thesis in 5 minute. (I think that did not work though ;) )
