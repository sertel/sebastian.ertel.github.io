Ohua in Big Data Systems	Talk	talk-ohua_bd	[9th International Workshop on Programming Models and Applications for Multicores and Manycores](https://ppopp18.sigplan.org/track/pmam-2018)	2018-02-25	Vienna, Austria	https://sertel.github.io/files/ohua_big_data_pmam_2018_talk.pdf	This talk gives a brief introduction on our approach to speed up sequential bottlenecks in big data systems (Hadoop Map/Reduce, Spark, Flink) using Ohua. This is where I introduced the idea behind `smap` for the first time.
